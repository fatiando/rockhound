    <h1 align="center">NOTICE: Development of RockHound has stopped.</h1>
    
Our focus has shifted to curating a set of data that has open licenses and serves as 
good sample data for tutorials and documentation. 
We're gathering and packaging these datasets in https://github.com/fatiando-data and 
have created the `Ensaio <https://www.fatiando.org/ensaio/>`__ package to load them.

About
-----

RockHound is a Python library to download geophysical models and datasets (PREM,
CRUST1.0, ETOPO1) and load them into Python data structures (pandas, numpy, xarray).

Many of these models use non-conventional file formats or can be tricky
to find on the internet. RockHound knows how to download them if you don't already have
them locally, read the file format, and return a nicely formatted data structure.
Under the hood, it uses `Pooch <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch>`__ to
manage the downloads.


Project goals
-------------

* Download commonly used models and datasets.
* Load data into ``pandas.DataFrame`` (tables) and ``xarray.Dataset`` (grids).
* Only download if needed and check downloads for corruption.
* Provide functions for visualizing complex models and datasets.


Contacting Us
-------------

* Most discussion happens `on Github <https://github.com/fatiando/rockhound>`__.
  Feel free to `open an issue
  <https://github.com/fatiando/rockhound/issues/new>`__ or comment
  on any open issue or pull request.
* We have `chat room on Gitter <https://gitter.im/fatiando/fatiando>`__
  where you can ask questions and leave comments.

Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equally important contributions include:
writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or implementing tests, or
even giving feedback about the project (including giving feedback about the
contribution process).
If you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and
assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from
those mistakes.
That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
